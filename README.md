# SkateSimulator
MARIONPINEDA_BGS TASK
In the simulator, you can move forward and rotate; you can also jump over the obstacles in the level, and in the UI, you can see how many obstacles you have jumped over.
This SkateSimulator uses the ThirdPersonTemplate, but the character movement has been modified to move as a skateboard, the level decoration comes from different assets, the skater and its animations come from Mixamo, and the skateboard skeleton is imported too. For the UI, it uses an external image and an external font.
This project has modified the character class and game mode class to add the UI behavior, add the skateboard skeleton, and change how the movement works. It has the Obstacle class as a new one, with a box collider that increases a counter in the character when they collide and tells the game mode to increase the UI counter too.
With the imported animation and skeleton, the animation blueprint can change according to whether the character is sliding, moving forward, or jumping.
To solve this problem, it was important to divide the tasks into animation, UI, and movement and choose what external things were necessary.
In my opinion, to complete this task, I have learned many things different about coding; the coding part was the easiest, and the animation part was the hardest. But all the process was fun investigating and creating something new. Sometimes it’s hard, but once it’s done, I feel proud of the result and the new knowledge. Finally, thank you for your attention and the opportunity that allowed me to create this simulator.
